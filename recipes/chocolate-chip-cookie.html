    <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Chocolate chip cookies are one of the world's most popular desserts.
       Many of us have fond memories of eating them as children, often with a bowl of ice cream.
       They can be baked from pre-made batches you find in the refrigerated section at the grocery store, but we're going to do it the best way: homemade.
