    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Crispy fried chicken is a dish where chicken pieces are coated in a seasoned batter or breading and deep-fried, pan-fried, or pressure-fried until crispy and golden. 
       The coating often includes flour, spices like paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and sometimes buttermilk or eggs for a tender, juicy texture.
       The result is a crunchy exterior with savory, well-seasoned flavor, encasing moist, tender meat.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable order for frying</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a large platic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).
         Season flour with paprika (which helps to brown the chicken), salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li>
        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.
         LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>
        <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).
          Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts.
          Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
      </ol>
